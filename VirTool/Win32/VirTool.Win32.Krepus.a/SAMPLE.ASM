                                        Multiple Opcode Fantasies 32 bit v4.0
                                                                  SAMPLE CODE
                                                         by Lord Julus - 1999

        This sample file is used by the demo generator.
        It will be copied with different names and a decryptor will be placed
        at the end.
        The exe file will decrypt itself and run correctly as this uncrypted
        sample does (the file displays a window on the screen).

        Compile this file like this:

                TASM32 -m -ml sample.asm
                TLINK32 -Tpe -aa sample,,,import32.lib
                PEWRSEC sample.exe (very important!!!!!)

        I included PEWRSEC in the package as it is very important!!
