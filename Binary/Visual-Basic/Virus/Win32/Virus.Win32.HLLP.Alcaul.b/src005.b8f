   'this file infector is composed of two components, the pseudo-header and the virus..
   'it infects exe files in its own directory in this manner...


   '-------------                      -----------------
   'pseudo-header         -------------          pseudo-header
   '-------------   -------->       host     -------->     -----------------
   'virus             -------------                       host
   '-------------                      -----------------
   '                                 virus
   '                           -----------------



   'when infected files are executed, the virus/pseudo-header will find another host, infect it in the same manner...then the
   'host will be executed by the virus with no problemos....

   'most important thing, one infection per run...

   'and displays a messagebox to alert the user that he or she has a vb virus....
