             SABi¡ Second Edition (S2)

             S2 isn't a virus done only by NBK &amp; Ultras, but from all the peoples mentioned in the greetz in the virus body. Without their help and many other things, this release will be impossible.
             S2 is a continuation of the first version (called MTX by AVers), but with much more improvements.

             - Infect .EXE filez compressing it
             - Emails with subject and text about sex
             - Avoid infect anti-virus filez, if this is not possible, tries to patch anti-viral code
             - Create dropper in .ARJ filez
             - TSR (Sleep)
             - Patch AV-VXD code via ring-0 (Win 9x only)
             - Anti-SoftIce and others debuggers
             - Infect popular programs by searching ALL avaiable fixed/remote drives

11.12.2000   - SABi¡-2 tries to spawn in disk in \winsys\ or \temp\ directories always with random names.
             - Update engine deleted, doing a new one, looking for compatibility with Hybris.
15.12.2000   - Added KME32 from Z0MBiE and Vecna in infected filez loader.
18.12.2000   - Added hook in recv() api, from WSOCK32.DLL/WS2_32.DLL. Isn't fully working at the moment, but is able to pass control back perfectly.
24.12.2000   - Direct calls to Import Table changed, maybe disassembly harder
25.12.2000   - Added support for LoadLibrary() in loader, now S2 will search for GetProcAddress(), LoadLibrary() and GetModuleHandle(), in this order, before infect filez.
             - Most strings removed from .data section, now they're in the virus body, PUSHED to stack
             - Loader optimized, now it is only 848 bytes (without poly engine)
26.12.2000   - Added a second loader, now S2 don't will be the same file when spawned to disk by infected filez, but will have a polymorphic loader, that will decrypt, get api's and set the new priority for this new thread.
             - All the imports were removed, now only LoadLibrary() and GetProcAddress() are imported, many ideas got from "Hybris".
30.12.2000   - After many tests, crashes and debugs, S2 now is fully polymorphic. KME32 was implemented to the main .EXE code and the main .EXE don't have a fixed size when spawned to disk from an infected application.

               S2 looks like this:

    MAIN .EXE S2:     INFECTED APPLICATION:
    ______________     ______________
   |_POLY LOADER__|   |_POLY LOADER__|
   |______+_______|   |______+_______|
   |____PACKED____|   |____PACKED____|
   |_ENCRYPTED_X_2|   |__ENCRYPTED___|
   |__REAL DATA___|   |_POLYMORPHIC__|
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   |_MAIN .EXE S2_|
                      |______+_______|
                      |ORIGINAL CODE_|
                      |FROM THIS FILE|
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
