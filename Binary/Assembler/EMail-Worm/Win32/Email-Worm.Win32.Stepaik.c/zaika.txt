I applied some my new ideas in this worm. The main idea - to add  complex  hll 
code that works with Internet to assembler virus. This extremely economize time
for creation of worm.  And, of  course,  simplifies  worm's  modification  and 
upgrading. I used my dllload engine for this aim.

Description:
This worm based on my Nastena virus. Written in Assembler & C++. Spreads    via 
Kazaa networks and by hooking winsock2 send call in these  mailing    programs:
Outlook Express (tested on 6.00.2600 eng), The Bat! (1.62, 2.00), Mozilla (1.0)
Worm running residently in Explorer process and creates  a  thread  in  one  of
these mailers. This thread intercepts LoadLibraryA,   GetProcAddress  and  send
apis in the mailer. All outgoing traffic goes thru the worm that adds itself as 
attach. Moreover worm adds IFrame  in   the  letter's body  in the case of html
letter.
Attach is formed by creating a copy of one of  Windows  files and infecting it.
Then infected file is copied into shared memory space and deleted. 
Infection process is similar to Win32.Nastena's one but the encryption of viral
body became stronger a bit.
Payload: worm creates a socks4 proxy at 2026 port. I could add  a  trojan horse
to it but I did not because I am too lazy ))
