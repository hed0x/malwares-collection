    Microbe virus is now nearing extinction and might only exist in virus 
    collections because of its inability to infect disks other than 360 kb 
    diskettes.
 
    I am bringing it to you in its original form so that you can get a 
    personal look at the virus. 
 
    The Microbe dropper program checks a diskette if it is a 360 kb before 
    implanting the virus on the diskette. If you do not have a 5.25" floppy 
    disk drive nor a 360 kb diskette, tough luck. If you decide to modify the 
    dropper source code so that it will infect diskettes other than 360 kb, 
    that is up to you. But you might get errors when you use that diskette 
    because Microbe does not retain the data in the boot sector needed by your 
    computer.
 
    The virus dropper was compiled using tasm 2.01
 
           tasm microdrp;
           tlink /t microdrp;
 
    If you want to use the a86 compiler, delete all lines that contain 
    "align 2" and "align 16" directives.
 
 
    To create an executable program from the debug script,
 
           debug &lt; microdrp.scr
 
 
    Remember to cut everything from the start of the file up to the start of 
    the listing, and evrything from the end of the listing up to the end of 
    the file. This is applicable to both microdrp.asm and microdrp.scr.
 
    And lastly, I want you to know that when you compile the listing in this 
    file (asm source and/or debug script) you are creating a program that will 
    implant the Microbe virus in a diskette. 
 
    I assume that you have already read the disclaimer in HEXFILE1.000 file. 
    If not read it before anything else.
