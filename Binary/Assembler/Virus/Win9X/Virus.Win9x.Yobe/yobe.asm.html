</span><span class="sc1">;Hey reader! R u st0ned or drunk enough? If not, then don't read this, coz this</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;is really crazy. Let me introduce u FIRST FAT12 infector (cluster/directory</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;virus, this is also used to call), fully compatible with windozes (Win98)!</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;No no, that's not enough. This is also resident, multithreaded in both of</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;Ring-0 and Ring-3 levels with anti-debugging, anti-heuristic, anti-emulator and</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;anti-monitor features, using Win9X backdoor to call DOS services and working</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;with CRC32, Windows registry and API functions.</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;Among all these features, I don't hope it has any chances to spread outta</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;world. It infects only diskettes (A: only) and only one file - SETUP.EXE. More</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;crazy than u thought, nah? Yeah, I'm lazy so I didn't want to test my code on</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;my harddisk and I also didn't want to think about infication of more than one</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;file. When I finished Win98.BeGemot, I was totally b0red of those stupid PE</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;headerz, RVAs and such like. I wanted to code something really original, not</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;next average-b0ring virus. I hope I successed. This virus doesn't demonstrate</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;only porting old techniques (c Dir-II virus) to new enviroment, but also</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;hot-new techniques (e.g. Ring0 threads). To be this virus really heavilly</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;armoured is missing some poly/meta engine. Unfortunately, this conception of</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;virus doesn't allow me to implement such engines (neither compression), coz</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;I can't modify virus code. However, I included many usefull trix to fool</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;debuggerz as well as heuristic scannerz. Bad thing is that this babe is</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;detectable by NODICE32 - NODICE32 can find suspicious code (such as modifying</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;IDT) and so it immediately reports an unknown virus. There ain't chance to</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;improve it, coz I can't use any kind of encryption. Fortunately, other AVs</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;find sh!t :D. I hope u will like this piece of work (it took me much time to</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;code it, albeit it is very small (code is small, headerz r huge :) and</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;optimized) and u will learn much from that. U want probably ask me, why I didn't</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;coded stealth virus. U r right, It's easy to implement full-stealth mechanism,</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;but, but, ... I won't lie u - I'm lazy :).</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;Gimme know, if u will have any comments, if u will find any bugs or anything</span><span class="sc0">

</span><span class="sc1">;6) Check for SoftICE</span><span class="sc0">

</span><span class="sc1">;Benny's notes: This is much better description than at BeGemot virus. However,</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;I would have some notes, see [* *] marx:</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;Win95.Yobe [* Fully compatible with Win98, so why Win95? *]</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;This is a dangerous [* why dangerous?! *] memory resident parasitic Windows</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;virus. It uses system calls that are valid under Win95/98 only and can't spread</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;under NT. The virus also has bugs and often halts the system when run [* when,</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;where, why? *]. Despite on this the virus has very unusual way of spreading,</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;and it is interesting enough from technical point of view [* I hope it is *].</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;The virus can be found only in two files: "SETUP.EXE" on floppy disks and</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;"SETUP .EXE" in the root of the C: drive (there is one space between file name</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;and ".EXE" extension). </span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;On the floppy disks the virus uses a trick to hide its copy. It writes its</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;complete code to the last disk sectors and modifies the SETUP.EXE file to read</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;and execute this code.</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;The infected SETUP.EXE file looks just as 512 bytes DOS EXE program, but it is</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;not. While infecting this file the virus uses "DirII" virus method: by direct</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;disk sectors read/write calls the virus gets access to disk directory sectors,</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;modifies "first file cluster" field and makes necessary changes in disk FAT</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;tables. As a result the original SETUP.EXE code is not modified, but the</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;directory entry points to virus code instead of original file clusters. </span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;When the infected SETUP.EXE is run from the affected floppy disk this DOS</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;component of the virus takes control, reads the complete virus body from the</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;last sectors on the floppy disk, then creates the "C:\SETUP .EXE" file, writes</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;these data (complete virus code) to there and executes. The virus installation</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;routine takes control then, installs the virus into the system and disinfect</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;the SETUP.EXE file on the floppy drive. </span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;While installing itself into the system the virus creates [* opens *] the new</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;key in the system registry to activate itself on each Windows restart: </span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run </span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;  YOBE=""C:\SETUP .EXE" YOBE"</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;The virus then switches to the Windows kernel level (Ring0), allocates a block</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;of system memory, copies itself to there and hooks disk file access Windows</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;functions (IFS API). This hook intercepts file opening calls and on opening</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;the SETUP.EXE file on the A: drive the virus infects it. </span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;The virus has additional routines. First of them looks for "AVP Monitor" and</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;"Amon Antivirus Monitor" windows and closes them; the second one depending on</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;random counter displays the line with the words "YOBE" to the left side of the</span><span class="sc0">
