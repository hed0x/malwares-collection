So, that's my 1st PE infector, it work in ring3. His work is easy to
understand: he allocate a timer then give back control to host.
The timer proc will browse the entire hard drive till the host finish,
while the host is working. For the rest, I think that thou are clever
enough to understand how i don't modify import entries etc...
Let's have fun!

Note: that virus is quite old and he got a bug: some hosts, when
closing it, happend to take all CPU time to call timer proc and
then don't stop either the program either the virus ( u have to use
ctrl-alt-del )
Note: It's for educational purpose only! You can use it as you
want, but I decline all the responsability in case of... etc. etc...
That's in order to help newbies, so SV will log each files it (try)
to infect in "c:\sv.log".

Files:  Sv.Asm : the main body of the virus
        Defs.Inc : some useful stuff to easier the import part
Not inclued here : Win32.Inc : some practical win32 constants etc.

Note: some part of code are here commented, that are the calls to
"MessageBox" when an infection is done or something like that,
uncomment'em to have a complete overview of what happend.
