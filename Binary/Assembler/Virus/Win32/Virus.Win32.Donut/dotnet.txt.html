Hello reader,

lemme introduce you my first Windows virus for .NET CLR architecture!
For next informationz read my article "Microsoft .NET Common Language
Runtime Overview.

.
Everything began when I started to explore the .NET Common Language Runtime
platform, designed by Microsoft. I wrote an article about it and started to
work on one very trivial virus that could show how to use class librariez.
Everything in C#.
The idea was very simple - create sample of prepender written in C#. How easy
it sounded, so hard to code it was. C#, such like Java have VERY STRICT type
checking. And I figured out that there's NO easy way how to work with
stringz - once a string is defined, you CAN'T change it - and I needed to
do that, becoz it was very important for viral functionality.

That sucked. I decided to forget that and go to my favourite techno-pub, talk
with some friendz and get some weed, becoz I hadn't smoked for long time.
Well, one my friend that I hadn't seen for a half a year brought me some very
good skunk....
when I came home, I couldn't sleep, even it was after midnight. I was very
tired, but becoz of that weed, 2 litres of Coke inside my stomach and
unfinished C# virus it was unable for me to fall alseep. Then I saw the
CLEAR light...for a few secondz I watched only that but then I saw whole MSIL PE
structure and there my virus how fits there. It was wonderful idea how to
modify PE structure and CLR header and keep it working, together with virus.
And that time everything began..
For curious ppl I can say that after that I stayed awake for next two and half
of hour :-) Heh, Paul McCartney composed Yesterday song while he was sleeping,
so why shouldn't I get some kewl idea in the bed too? &lt;BP&gt;
.

But now let's talk about more technical thingz - the virus itself. The 95
percentz of whole virus is written in win32 assembler, the rest is in MSIL.
How the virus worx? Virus can work only with some specific MSIL PE filez, mostly
generated by C# compiler. The virus aint complex much, but it shows some very
interesting thingz that can be done in .NET environment.

So, how does it can infect MSIL PE filez?
Virus enlargez the (last) relocation section and copiez its body there. Then
it locatez CLR header, save host's metadata and overwritez them by viral
metadata. The virus also uses EPO (EntryPoint Obscuring) for setting entrypoint
- it overwritez CLR dispatcher by JMP &lt;virus&gt; code and removez CLR descriptor.
After execution such infected file the virus code instead of CLR dispatcher
is called. Virus, after it finishes all needed actionz, repairz CLR descriptor
and executez the file - by this the viral metadata are executed. And in the
3rd stage the virus also repairz CLR descriptor and JMP &lt;dispatcher&gt; so
original (host's) metadata are executed. Easy and effective ;-)


Here follows the algorithm:

&lt;main&gt;
01) initialization - SEH frame, delta offset, K32 base, API addresses
02) infect all filez in current directory               *1*
03) infect so up to 20 directoriez by .. (dotdot) method.
04) create "drive:\path\hostfile .exe"
05) correct CLR descriptor field in data directory in PE header
06) save the file and execute it (viral metadata is activated)  *2*
07) wait for its termination
08) restore JMP DWORD PTR [dispatcher_entry] and CLR descriptor
09) create command line, save the file and execute it (host is activated)
10) wait for hosts termination and delete temporarz file ("hostfile .exe")
11) terminate viral process

&lt;*1* - infection stage&gt;
01) open the file (and enlarge it)
02) check PE header
03) erase base relocation record
04) check CLR header and structure
05) locate entrypoint and create JMP &lt;virus&gt;
06) save hosts metadata and copy there viral metadata
07) correct PE header and calculate new checksum
08) close file and quit

&lt;*2* - viral metadata&gt;
01) create new instance of System.Random class
02) call its constructor - System.Random::.ctor()
02) get random number (System.Random.Next())
03) 1:10 that virus will show Windows message box - payload


As you can see, my vision wasn't to code some super-spreading virus, but
only to show how it is possible to infect .NET applicationz - changing
PE structure, CLR header structure, implanting viral metadata etc...
The virus also ain't optimized much, becoz I wanted to have the source
readable also for not skilled coderz.

NOTE: if you will try to execute 1st generation code, the system loader
should 2 timez report errorz with loading - virus triez to execute those
2 repaired filez. Becoz there ain't any CLR header inside 1st generation
code, loader won't be able to load it. But for creating copiez of my
virus it ain't serious problem - virus can infect filez and since 2nd
generation it worx properly.
It is possible that virus containz some minor bugz (I have only 1 machine
with .NET architecture), but it shouldn't be anything that would cause
problemz with infection.


Well, I hope you will like my code. If you will have any commentz and/or
suggestionz, feel free to contact me.
