                                  since 1992
                     bringing you the viruses of tomorrow
                                    today!


Prologue:

Please excuse my English.  I'm still learning.


About the author:

Former  DOS/Win16  virus writer, author of several virus  families,  including
Ginger  (see Coderz #1 zine for terrible buggy example, contact me for  better
sources  ;),  and  Virus Bulletin 9/95 for a description of what  they  called
Rainbow.   Co-author  of  world's first virus using circular  partition  trick
(Orsam,  coded  with  Prototype in 1993).  Designer of the world's  first  XMS
swapping  virus (John Galt, coded by RTFishel in 1995, only 30 bytes stub, the
rest  is  swapped  out).   Author of world's first virus  using  Thread  Local
Storage  for  replication (Shrug).  Author of various retrovirus articles  (eg
see Vlad #7 for the strings that make your code invisible to TBScan).  Went to
sleep  for  a number of years.  This is my third virus for Win32.  It  is  the
world's first Native executable virus.  It took me weeks to research it.

I'm also available for joining a group.  Just in case anyone is interested. ;)


What are native applications?

I found out about native applications on the Sysinternals site.
(www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/info/native.shtml)
The  guy  describes there some things about how these files are  executed  and
which  APIs  they can use.  There are some bugs in his description, but mostly
it is good enough.  Native applications run in NT/2000/XP and they load before
the  Win32 subsystem loads (kernel32, user32, etc).  They have full access  to
the  file system and no privilege checks!  Most of the APIs are  undocumented,
but  if  you debug the kernel32 APIs, you see that they call the  native  APIs
(ntdll) and you can work out the important parameters.

Some points now:
Native applications can run from %Windows%, not just %System%.
The heap handle is available via [fs:[0x30]+0x18]).  No need to create heap.
NtProcessTerminate() runs if application crashes (so crash to save bytes :) ).
Native  applications must terminate before Win32 subsystem can load, so it  is
important to not take too much time.  There is no background execution here.


How to build a native application?

You'll need a copy of ntdll.lib to build a native application, but you can use
the native API without being a native application - just use GetModuleHandle()
to  load ntdll then GetProcAddress(), but know that privilege checks apply  to
native APIs used by not-native applications.


How to run a native application?

Native  applications use subsystem value of 1 and must have a valid  checksum.
They can be loaded using the registry by altering the data in

HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SessionManager\BootExecute

This  is  a MULT_SZ type so it is an array of null-terminated   strings,  with
extra  null  to  end the list.  When the entry point is  executed,  the  stack
contains  no return value.  Since I couldn't find anywhere that has the  ntdll
image  base, probably you must search memory.  I import a function from  ntdll
to know where to start looking.  They cannot be executed directly (but you can
use  RtlCreateProcess() to execute for testing, however SoftIce won't break on
hard-coded int 3, so be careful).


How to use the native APIs?

Here  are  the APIs from ntdll.dll that I have used.  The ones marked 'x'  are
unknown  to me, but the values are set by kernel32 and I had no need to change
them.  IO_STATUS_BLOCKs are altered just before the call returns, so if you do
not care about the status, then point with esp and it will be discarded.

Epilogue:

Now  you  want to look at my example code and then to make your own  examples.
There   are  many  possibilities  with  this  technique  that  make  it   very
interesting.  It is easy when you know how.  Just use your imagination.
