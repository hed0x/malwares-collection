</span><span class="sc1">;- Virus Incident Report - [ABOUT THE BETA VERSION (3.1)]</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;Oxygen3 24h-365d, by Panda Software</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;Last menace for this week is W23/Orochi.3982,[W23 WHAT???] a virus that affects</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;computers with Windows 98 and Windows NT. Its size is 3982 bytes and is</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;run in computers with Intel microprocessors which are capable of</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;interpreting MMX instructions.</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;After carrying out the infections, it activates itself on the 3rd of</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;July. Then it will substitute the original MBR (Master Boot Record)</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;whose task is to delete the CMOS and flash-BIOS memory, if it exists.</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;This is why W32/Orochi.3982 is considered to be a rather destructive</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;virus. [YES, IT IS]</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;W32/Orochi.3982 uses any of the usual techniques of propagation employed</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;by the existing viruses: floppy disks, CD-ROMs, other types of storage</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;units, working with system files in computer networks, the Internet,</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;downloads, sending and receiving e-mail messages to which the infected</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;file has been attached or included within the message itself,...etc.</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;After carrying out the infection, W32/Orochi.3982 remains in the system</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;until the date of its activation arrives. In this case it is the 3rd of</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;July. On activating it implements all its destructive payload.</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;· Substitution of the original MBR (Master Boot Record) by its own code</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;that helps it to carry out all the subsequent operations. </span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;· Deletion of the CMOS memory. Eliminates all the contents of this type</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;of memory that include, among other things, the boot and system</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;configuration settings.</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;· Deletion of the Flash-BIOS memory. </span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;When each of these objectives have been successfully attained, the virus</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;leaves the infected equipment completely disabled. </span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;W32/Orochi.3982 does not infect files employing the Windows 95 Operating</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;System due to the use of a special function, which this operating system</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;lacks. [NOW IS FIXED]</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;In the first place it checks to see the type of microprocessor installed</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;in the computer. If this has the capacity to interpret MMX instructions,</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;it continues with its task of infecting the machine, otherwise it</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;abandons this task.</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;The infection of files is produced when the minutes of the system reach</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;the numeric value of 30. At that moment the virus starts working on the</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;disk drives detected: C: D: E: F: G: and H:.</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;After the infection has occurred, W32/Orochi.3982 is activated on the</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;3rd of July and is highly destructive. It installs the new MBR (Master</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;Boot Record) in the hard disk of the computer infected and deletes the</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;contents of the CMOS and Flash BIOS memory. [SI, YA LO HAS DICHO]</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;Moreover, it also uses techniques that allow it to remain hidden and to</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;avoid detection by the resident protection that are used by some</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;antivirus programs. This way it is able to disable the scans used to</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;search for the viruses.</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;An anecdotal detail relating to the name of this virus: W32/Orochi.3982</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;comes from the character called Orochi who appears in a video game</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;called King Of Fighters, from the mythical eight-headed dragon called</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;Yamata-no-Orochi. [GOOD, GOOD THEY KNOW THE GAME!!! SURE THEY ARE PLAYING</span><span class="sc0">
