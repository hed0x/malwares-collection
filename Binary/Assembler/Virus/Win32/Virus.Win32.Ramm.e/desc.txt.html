     ====================================================================
     History:

     09 Sep 2000 - Today I made a small improvement. When the dropper roams
                   the net onto another computer it remains in the windows
                   dir and it represents a weak point which might be noticed
                   by an av. So, now, the virus will smartly remove either
                   the dropper or the entry in the win.ini file if one of
                   them is missing. If both are there, they are left alone
                   because they will remove eachother. Added Pstores.exe to
                   the black list. Thanks to Evul for pointing me out that
                   it is a rather peculiar file and cannot be safely
                   infected.

     22 Jul 2000 - The virus has moved up to version 4.0. Today I added
                   the network infector. It comes in a separate thread.
                   For the moment looks like everything works fine. Will
                   add a timer to it so that it does not hang in huge
                   networks... Virus is above 14k now... Waiting for the
                   LZ!

     18 Jul 2000 - Fixed a bug in the section increase algorithm: if you
                   want to have a good compatibility you NEED to place the
                   viral code exactly at the end of file and NOT at the
                   end of the VirtualSize or SizeOfRawData as it appears
                   in the section header, because many files get their
                   real size calculated at load time in some way.
                   HURRAY!!! YES!! I fixed a shitty bug! If you do section
                   add you MUST check also if any directory VA follows
                   immediately the last section header so that you will
                   not overwrite it. Now almost all files work ok under
                   NT!!!! However, I don't seem to be able to make
                   outlook.exe get infected so I put it on the black list.
                   The other MsOffice executables get infected correctly
                   on both Win9x and WinNT.

     17 Jul 2000 - Have started some optimizations and proceduralizations
                   (;-)))). The virus is quickly going towards 13k so I
                   am quite anxious to implement my new LZ routine to
                   decrease it's size. I fixed a bug: WinNT NEEDS the
                   size of headers value to be aligned to file alignment.

     14 Jul 2000 - Worked heavily on the WindowsNT compatibility. In this
                   way I was able to spot 2 bugs in the infection routine,
                   one regarding RVA of the new section and one regarding
                   the situation when the imports cannot be found by the api
                   hooker. Still thinking if I should rearrange relocs also?
                   Now files are loaded under WindowsNT (NT image is correct)
                   but they cannot fully initialize. Will research some
                   more.

     03 Jun 2000 - Added an encryption layer with no key, just a rol/ror
                   routine on parity. Also added some MMX commands. Fixed
                   a few things.

     22 May 2000 - Added EPO on files that have the viral code outside the
                   code section. Basically from now on the entry point stays
                   only into the code section. The epo is not actually epo,
                   because as I started to code it I decided to make it very
                   complicated so I will include the complicated part in the
                   next release. It will be the so called LJILE32 &lt;Lord
                   Julus' Instruction Length Engine 32&gt;. This engine will
                   allow me to have an exact location of the opcode for each
                   instruction so we will be able to look up any call, jump
                   or conditional jump to place our code call there. So for
                   this version only a jump at the original eip.

     21 May 2000 - Fixed a bug in the api hooker... I forgot that some import
                   sections have a null pointer to names. Also added the
                   infection by last section increase for files who cannot
                   be infected otherwise. All files should be touched now.
                   Also I fixed the problem with the payload window not
                   closing after the process closed. I solved half of it
                   as some files like wordpad.exe still have this problem.

     20 May 2000 - Prizzy helped me a lot by pointing out to me that in
                   order to have the copro working ok I need to save it's
                   environment so that the data of the victim process in
                   not altered. thanx!! Also fixed the cpuid read.

     14 May 2000 - Released first beta version to be tested

     ====================================================================
     Virus Name ........... Win32.Rammstein
     Virus Version ........ 4.0
     Virus Size ........... 13346 (debug), 14520 (release)
     Virus Author ......... Lord Julus / 29A
     Release Date ......... 04 May 2000
     Virus type ........... PE infector
     Target OS ............ Win95, Win98, WinNT, Win2000
     Target Files ......... many PE file types:
                            EXE COM ACM CPL HDI OCX PCI
                            QTC SCR X32 CNV FMT OCM OLB WPC
     Append Method ........ The  virus will check wether there is enough room
                            for  it  inside the code section. If there is not
                            enough  room  the virus will be placed at end. If
                            there  is  it  will  be  inserted inside the code
                            section  at  a  random  offset while the original
                            code will be saved at end. The placing at the end
                            has  also  two  variants.  If the last section is
                            Resources  or Relocations the virus will insert a
                            new section before the last section and place the
                            data  there,  also rearranging the last section's
                            RVAs.  If  the  last section is another section a
                            new  section  will  be placed at end. The name of
                            the new section is a common section name which is
                            choosed  based  on  the existing names so that it
                            does  not  repeat.  If the virus is placed at the
                            end just a small EPO code is used so that the eip
                            stays inside the code section.
                            A  special situation occurs if there is no enough
                            space  to  add  a new section header, for example
                            when  the  code section starts at RVA 200 (end of
                            headers).   In  this  situation  the  virus  will
                            increase the last section in order to append.
     Infect Methods ....... -Direct  file  attacks:  the  virus  will  attack
                            specific  files  in  the windows directory, files
                            which are most used by people
                            -Directory   scan:   all  files  in  the  current
                            directory will be infected, as well as 3 files in
                            the   system  directory  and  3  in  the  windows
                            directory
                            -Api  hooking  (per-process residency): the virus
                            hooks  a  few  api calls and infects files as the
                            victim  uses  the  apis
                            -Intranet  spreading:  the virus spreads into the
                            LAN using only windows apis
     Features ............. Multiple  threads:  the  virus  launches  a  main
                            thread.  While  this thread executes, in the same
                            time,  the original thread returns to host, so no
                            slowing  down  appears.  The  main  viral  thread
                            launches  other  6  threads  and  monitors  their
                            execution.  If  one of the threads is not able to
                            finish  the  system  is  hanged  because it means
                            somebody tryied to patch some of the thread code.
                            Heavy  anti-debugging:  i tried to use almost all
                            the  anti-debug  and  anti-emulation stuff that I
                            know
                            FPU: uses fpu instructions
                            Crc32 search: uses crc32 to avoid waste of space
                            Memory  roaming:  allocates  virtual  memory  and
                            jumps in it
                            Interlaced  code:  this  means  that some threads
                            share  the  same  piece  of code and the virus is
                            careful   to  let  only  one  in  the  same  time
                            otherwise we get some of the variables distroyed.
                            Preety hard to be emulated by avs.
                            Also features semaphores, timers
                            Marks infection using the Pythagoreic numbers.
                            SEH: the virus creates 9 SEH handlers, for each
                            thread and for the main thread.
(*)  Polymorphic .......... Yes (2 engines: LJMLPE32, LJFPE32)
(*)  Metamorphic .......... Yes (mild custom metamorphic engine)
     Encrypted ............ Yes
     Safety ............... Yes (avoids infecting many files)
     Kill AV Processes .... Yes
     Payload .............. On  14th  every  even  month the infected process
                            will  launch  a  thread  that will display random
                            windows  with  some  of  the  Rammstein's lyrics.
                            Pretty  annoying...  Probably  this  is the first
                            virus  that  actually  creates  real  windows and
                            processes  their  messages. The windows shut down
                            as the victim process closes.


     (*) Feature not included in this version.

     Debug notes: please note that this source code features many ways of
     debugging. You may turn on and off most of the virus's features by
     turning some variables to TRUE or FALSE.
