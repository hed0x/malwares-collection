     one who lives on the desert
     "I, too, am the Soul of the Desert; thou
     shalt seek me yet again in the wilderness
     of sand."
     Liber LXV, IV, 61
     I
     The Journey
   The soul is in its own nature, perfect purity, perfect calm, perfect silence;
   and as a well springs from the very veins of the earth itself, so is the soul
   nurtured of the blood of God, the ecstasy of things.
   This soul can never be injured, never marred, never defiled. Yet all things
   added to it do for a time trouble it; and this is sorrow.
   To this, language itself bears witness; for all words which mean unhappy mean
   first of all disturbed, disquieted, troubled. The root idea of sorrow is this
   idea of stirring up.
   For many a year man in his quest for happiness has travelled a false road. To
   quench his thirst he has added salt in ever increasing quantities to the water
   of life; to cover the ant heaps of his imagination he has raised mountains
   wherein wild beasts and deadly prowl. To cure the itch, he has flayed the
   patient; to exorcise the ghost, he has evoked the devil.
   It is the main problem of philosophy, how this began. The Rishis, seven that sat
   on Mount Kailasha and considered thus answered, that the soul became
   self-conscious; and crying, "I am That!" became two even in the act of asserting
   it was One. This theory may be found not too remote from truth by whoso returns
   to that tower upon the ramparts of the soul and beholds the city.
   But let us leave it to the doctors to discuss the cause of the malady; for the
   patients it is enough to know the cure and take it. Abana and Pharpar, rivers of
   Damascus, are not worth the simplicity of Jordan. The prophet has spoken; it is
   our concern not to obey: and so sweet and so full of virtue are these waters
   that the first touch thrills the soul with the sure foretaste of its cure.
   Doubt not, brother! reason indeed may elaborate complexities; are not these the
   very symptoms of the disease? Use but the rude common sense, heritage of simpler
   and happier forefathers, that they have transmitted to thee by the wand.
   The cure of disease is ease; of disquiet, quiet; of strife, peace. And to attain
   horsemanship the study of folios aids not, but the mounting of a horse; as the
   best way to swim is to enter the water and strike out; so it is cool sense, not
   feverish reason, that says: to attain quiet, practice quiet.
   There are men so strong of will, so able to concentrate the mind, to neglect the
   impressions that they do not wish to receive, that they can withdraw themselves
   from their surroundings, even when those are as multitudinous and insistent as
   those of a great city. But for the most part of men, it is best to begin in
   easier circumstances, to climb the mountain in fine weather before attacking it
   in the snowstorm.
   And yet the eager aspirant will answer: I’rovided that the cure is complete.
   Provided that the sickness does not return when the medicine is stopped.
   Ah! that were hard: so deepseated is the malady that years after its symptoms
   have passed, it seizes on a moment of weakness to blaze out again. It is
   malarial fever that lurks low, that hides in the very substance of the blood
   itself, that has made the very fountain of life partaker with it in the
   sacrament of death.
     "Has a spider found out the communion-cup?
     "Was a toad in the christening font?"
   No: the remedy cures surely enough; but not often does it cure once for all,
   beyond relapse. But it is simple; once the symptoms have properly abated, they
   never return with equal force; and if the patient has but the wit to stretch out
   the hand for another does, the fever dies.
   What is then the essential? To cure the patient once; to give him faith in the
   efficacy of the remedy, so that perchance he falls sick, and no doctor is near,
   he may be able to cure himself.
   If Thought then be that which troubles the soul, there is but one way to take.
   Stop thinking.
   It is the most difficult task that man can undertake. "Give me a fulcrum for my
   lever", said Archimedes, "and I will move the earth." But how, when one is
   within, and part of, that very system of motion which one desired to stop?
   Newton´s First Law drops like the headman´s axe on the very nape of our
   endeavour. Well for us that this is not true as it is obvious! For this fact
   saves us, that the resolution of all these is rest. The motion is but in
   reciprocal pairs; the sum of its vectors is zero, The knot of the Universe is a
   fool´s knot; for all it seems Gordian; pull but firmly, and it ravels out. It is
   this seeming that is all the mischief; gloomy is the gulf, and the clouds gather
   angrily in monstrous shapes; the false moon flickers behind them; abyss upon
   abyss opens on every hand. Darkness and menace; the fierce sounds of hostile
   things!
   One glimmer of starlight, and behold the golden bridge!
   Narrow and straight, keen as the razor´s edge and glittering as the sword´s
   blade, a proper bridge if thou leanest not to right nor left, Cross it - good!
   but all this is in the dream. Wake! Thou shalt know that all together, gulf,
   moon, bridge, dragon and the rest, were but the phantasms of sleep, howbeit,
   remember this, that to cross the bridge in sleep is the only way to waking.
   I do not know if many men have the same experience as myself in the matter of
   voluntary dreaming, or rather of contest between the sought and the unsought in
   dream. For instance, I am on a ridge of ice with Oscar Eckenstein. He slips to
   one side. I throw myself on the other. We begin to cut steps up to the ridge; my
   axe snaps, or is snatched from my hand. We begin to pull ourselves up to the
   ridge by the rope; the rope begins to fray. Luckily it is caught lower down on a
   cleft of rock. A Lammergeier swoops; I invent a pistol and blow its brains out.
   And so on through a thousand adventures, making myself master of each event as
   it arises. But I am grown old to-day and weary of thrills. Nowadays at first
   hint of danger I take wings and sail majestically down to the glacier.
   If I have digressed, it is to superpose this triangle on that of the task "Stop
   Thinking." Simple it sounds, and simple it is - when you have mastery. In the
   meantime it is apt to lead you far indeed from simplicity. I have myself written
   some million words in order to stop thinking! I have covered miles of canvas
   with pounds of paint in order to stop thinking. Thus may it be that I am at
   least to be considered as no mean authority on all the wrong ways; and so
   perhaps, by a process of exclusion, on the right way!
     Unfortunately, it is not as easy as this:....
     There are nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal lays.
     And every single one of them is right.
     And right for A is often wrong for B.
   But, luckily, the simpler the goal is kept, the simpler are the means. Elsewhere
   in my writings will be found a fairly painstaking and accurate account of the
   process. The present essay is but to advocate a mighty engine adjuvant - the
   shoulder of Hercules to the cart-wheel of the beginner whose diffidence whispers
   that he is incapable of following those instructions in the difficult
   circumstances of ordinary life, or for the enthusiast who wisely determines like
   Kirkpatrick to ‘mak siccar’. Indeed, the cares of this world, the deceitfulness
   of the riches, the lusts of the flesh and the eye, the pride of life, and all
   the other enemies of the saint, do indeed choke the word, and it becometh
   unfruitful,
   II
     The Desert
     As a monastery imposes the false peace of dullness by its unwholesome and
     artificial monotony, so is the desert nature´s own cure for all the
     tribulations of thought.
   There the soul undergoes a triplex weaving. First, the newness of the
   surroundings, their strange and salient simplicity charm the Soul. It has a
   premonition of its cure; it feels the atmosphere of home. It is sure of its
   vocation. Next, the mind, its frivolity once satiate with novelty, becomes
   bored, turns to acrimony, even to passionate revolt. The novice beats against
   the bars; the stranger to the desert flies to London or to Paris with the devil
   at his heels. A wise superior will not restrain the acolyte who cannot restrain
   himself; but in the desert, the refugee, if he doubts his own powers - still
   more, maybe, if he does not mistrust them! - would wisely make it impossible to
   return. But how should he do so? Believe me, who have tried it, the longest
   journey, the Most bitter hardships, are as nothing, an arrow-flight of joy, when
   the great horror lies behind and the sanctuary of Paris ahead!
   For, indeed, this is the great horror, solitude, when the soul can no longer
   bathe in the ever-changing mind, laugh as its sunlit ripples lap its skin, but,
   shut up in the castle of a few thoughts, paces its narrow prison, wearing down
   the stone of time, feeding on its own excrement. There is no star in the
   blackness of that night, no foam upon that stagnant and putrid sea. Even the
   glittering health that the desert brings to the body, is like a spear in the
   soul´s -throat. The passionate ache to act, to think: this eats into the soul
   like a cancer. It is the scorpion striking itself in its agony, save that no
   poison can add to the torture of the circling fire; no superflux of anguish
   relieve it by annihilation. But against these paroxisms is an eightfold
   sedative. The ravings of madness are lost in soundless space; the struggles of
   the drowning men are not heeded by the sea.
   These are the eight genii of the desert. They are the eight Elements of Fohi:
     Male Female
     The Lingam (Life)
     The Yoni (Space. The Stars.)
     The Sun The Moon
     Fire Water
     Air (Wood) Earth
   In the desert all these are single; all these are naked. They are pure and
   untroubled; not breaking up and dissolving by any comingling or communion; each
   remains itself and apart, harmonizing indeed with its fellows, but in no wise
   interfering. The lines of demarcation are crude and harsh; but softness is
   incomprehensibly the result. They are immitigable, these eight elements, and
   together they mitigate immeasurably. The mind that revolts against them is
   ground down by their persistent careless pressure. It is as when one throws a
   crystal - say of microscopic salt - into water; it is eaten silentIy and
   rapidly, and is no more; the water is untroubled always; its action is like
   Fate´s, infinitely irresistible yet infinitely calm.
   So the mind reaches out to think this or think that; it is brought back into
   silence by the eight great facts. The desert wind suffers no obstacle to impede
   it; the sun shines invincibly upon the baked earth of the village; the sand
   invisibly eats up the oasis, save for a moment where man casts up his earthworks
   against it. Yet despite this, the spring leaps unexpected from the sand, and no
   simoom can stifle, nor even evaporate it; nor can the immense sterillty of the
   desert conquer life. Look where you will, every dune of sand has its inhabitants
   - not colonists, but natives of the inhospitable-seeming waste. The moon itself,
   serenely revolving about earth, changes in appearance, as if to say: "Even so
   goest thou about the sun. Am I new or full? Never think of it; that is but the
   point of view from which thou chancest to regard me. I am but a mirror of
   sunlight, dark or bright according to the angle of thy gaze, Does the mirror
   alter? Is it not always the untroubled silver? Have not I always one face turned
   sunward? Thou but mockest thyself if thou call me ‘The Changeful.’
   With such reflections or their kin, it may be, shalt thou make an end of the
   revolt of the mind against the desert.
   For life itself, here in the oasis, is a thing ordered by these elements. Night
   is for sleep; there is nothing whereat to wake. There is no artificial light; no
   artificial food - literature. There is no choice of meats; one is always hungry.
   The desert sauce is hunger, unique as the Englishman´s one sauce. Having eaten,
   one must walk; there is only one place to walk in. There is only one lesson to
   learn, peace; only one comment upon the lesson, thanksgiving. Love itself
   becomes simple as the rest of life. A glance in the Cafe Maure, a silent
   agreement with delight, a soft withdrawal to some hollow of the dunes under the
   stars where the village is blotted out as though it had never been, as are in
   that happy moment all the transgressions of the sinner, and all the woes of
   life, by the Virtue of the Holy One; or else to some dim corner of a garden of
   the oasis by the stream, where through the softly stirring palms strike the
   first moon-ray from the East, and life thrills in sleepy unison; all, all in
   silence, not names or vows exchanged, but with clean will an act accomplished.
   No more. No turmoil, no confusion, no despair, no self-tormenting, hardly even a
   memory.
   And this too at first is horrible; one expects so much from love; three volumes
   of falsehood, a labyrinth rather than a garden. It is hard at first to realize
   that this is no more love than a carbuncle is part of a man´s neck. All the
   spices wherewith we are wont to season the dish to our depraved palates,
   Maxim´s, St, Margaret´s, automobile rides, the Divorce Court, these are
   unwholesome pleasures. They are not love. Nor is love the exaltation of
   emotions, sentiment, follies. The stagedoor is not love, (nor is the stile in
   Lover´s Lane); love is the bodily ecstasy of dissolution, the pang of bodily
   death, wherein the Ego for a moment that is an aeon loses the fatal
   consciousness of itself; and becoming one with that of another, foreshadows to
   itself that greater sacrament of death, when "the spirit returns to God that
   gave it."
   And this secret has also its part in the economy of life. By the road of silence
   one comes to the gate Or the City of God. As the mind is gradually stilled by
   the courage and endurance of the seeker, and by the warring might (that is peace
   unshakeable) of these Eight Elements of the Desert, so at last the Ego is found
   alone, unmasked, conscious of itself and of no other thing. This is the supreme
   anguish of the soul; it realizes itself as itself, as a thing separate from that
   which is not itself, from God, In this spasm there are two ways: if fear and
   pride are left in the soul, it shuts itself up, like a warlock in a tower,
   gnashing its teeth with agony. "I am I", it cries, "I will not lose myself", and
   in that state damned, it is slowly torn by the claws of circumstance and
   disintegrated bitterly, for all its struggles, throughout ages and ages, its
   rags to be cast piecemeal upon the dungheap without the city. But the soul that
   has understood the blessedness of that resignation which grasps the universe and
   devours it, which is without hope or fear, without faith or doubt, without hate
   or love, dissolves itself ineffably into the abounding bliss of God. It cries
   with Shelley, as the "chains of lead about its flight of fire" drop molten from
   its limbs: "I pant, I sink, I tremble, I expire", and in that last outbreaking
   is made one with the primal and final breath, the Holy Spirit of God.
   Such must be the climax of any retirement to the Desert on the part of any
   aspirant of the Mysteries who has the spark of that fire in him.
   He is drawn to physical quiescence (to regularity, simplicity, unity of motion)
   by, the constant example and compulsion of the Elements. He is obliged to
   introspection by the poverty of exterior impression, and through this he soon
   finds the sensation behind the thoughts, the perceptions behind the sensations,
   the laws underlying even the perception, and finally that consciousness which is
   the lawgiver. Sooner or later, according to his energy and the sanctification of
   his will, must he tear down the great veil and behold himself upon the shining
   walls of space, must he utter with shuddering rapture: "This is I!" Then let him
   choose!
   From this moment of the annihilation of the Self in Pan, he is cured of the
   disease, "self-knowledge." He may return among his fellows, and move among them
   as a king, shine among them as a star. To him will they turn insensibly for
   light; to him will they come for the healing of their wounds.
   He shall lift up the sacred Lance, and tonch therewith the side of the king,
   that was wounded by no lesser weapon; and the king shall be healed.
   He shall plunge the point of the Lance into the Holy Grail, and it shall again
   glow with life and ecstasy, giving forth its bounty of mysterious refreshment to
   all the company of knights.
   Then, should the rocks of life tear him, and its snow chill him, knoweth he not
   where to turn? Hath he not attained the secret? Has he not entered into the
   Sanctuary of the Most High?
   Is he not chosen and armed against all things? Is he not master of Destiny and
   of the Event? What can touch him, who hath become intangible, being lost in God?
   Or conquer him, who hath become unconquerable, having conquered himself and
   given himself up to God? As well write upon the sand, as write sorrow in his
   soul. As well seek to darken the Sun, as to put out the Light that is in him.
   Thus I wrote in the palm gardens of Tozeur, by the waters of its spring; thus I
   wrote while the sun moved mightily down the sky, and the wind whispered that it
   came no whence and went no whither, even as it listed, from everlasting to
   everlasting.

   The soul is in its own nature, perfect purity, perfect calm, perfect silence;
   and as a well springs from the very veins of the earth itself, so is the soul
   nurtured of the blood of God, the ecstasy of things.
   This soul can never be injured, never marred, never defiled. Yet all things
   added to it do for a time trouble it; and this is sorrow.
   To this, language itself bears witness; for all words which mean unhappy mean
   first of all disturbed, disquieted, troubled. The root idea of sorrow is this

   to that tower upon the ramparts of the soul and beholds the city.
   But let us leave it to the doctors to discuss the cause of the malady; for the
   patients it is enough to know the cure and take it. Abana and Pharpar, rivers of
   Damascus, are not worth the simplicity of Jordan. The prophet has spoken; it is

   No: the remedy cures surely enough; but not often does it cure once for all,
   beyond relapse. But it is simple; once the symptoms have properly abated, they
   never return with equal force; and if the patient has but the wit to stretch out
   the hand for another does, the fever dies.
   What is then the essential? To cure the patient once; to give him faith in the
   efficacy of the remedy, so that perchance he falls sick, and no doctor is near,
   he may be able to cure himself.
   If Thought then be that which troubles the soul, there is but one way to take.
   Stop thinking.
   It is the most difficult task that man can undertake. "Give me a fulcrum for my

   this seeming that is all the mischief; gloomy is the gulf, and the clouds gather
   angrily in monstrous shapes; the false moon flickers behind them; abyss upon
   abyss opens on every hand. Darkness and menace; the fierce sounds of hostile
   things!
   One glimmer of starlight, and behold the golden bridge!
   Narrow and straight, keen as the razor´s edge and glittering as the sword´s
   blade, a proper bridge if thou leanest not to right nor left, Cross it - good!
   but all this is in the dream. Wake! Thou shalt know that all together, gulf,
   moon, bridge, dragon and the rest, were but the phantasms of sleep, howbeit,
   remember this, that to cross the bridge in sleep is the only way to waking.
   I do not know if many men have the same experience as myself in the matter of

     As a monastery imposes the false peace of dullness by its unwholesome and
     artificial monotony, so is the desert nature´s own cure for all the
     tribulations of thought.
   There the soul undergoes a triplex weaving. First, the newness of the
   surroundings, their strange and salient simplicity charm the Soul. It has a
   premonition of its cure; it feels the atmosphere of home. It is sure of its
   vocation. Next, the mind, its frivolity once satiate with novelty, becomes
   bored, turns to acrimony, even to passionate revolt. The novice beats against
   the bars; the stranger to the desert flies to London or to Paris with the devil
   at his heels. A wise superior will not restrain the acolyte who cannot restrain
   himself; but in the desert, the refugee, if he doubts his own powers - still
   more, maybe, if he does not mistrust them! - would wisely make it impossible to
   return. But how should he do so? Believe me, who have tried it, the longest
   journey, the Most bitter hardships, are as nothing, an arrow-flight of joy, when
   the great horror lies behind and the sanctuary of Paris ahead!
   For, indeed, this is the great horror, solitude, when the soul can no longer
   bathe in the ever-changing mind, laugh as its sunlit ripples lap its skin, but,
   shut up in the castle of a few thoughts, paces its narrow prison, wearing down
   the stone of time, feeding on its own excrement. There is no star in the
   blackness of that night, no foam upon that stagnant and putrid sea. Even the
   glittering health that the desert brings to the body, is like a spear in the
   soul´s -throat. The passionate ache to act, to think: this eats into the soul
   like a cancer. It is the scorpion striking itself in its agony, save that no
   poison can add to the torture of the circling fire; no superflux of anguish
   relieve it by annihilation. But against these paroxisms is an eightfold
   sedative. The ravings of madness are lost in soundless space; the struggles of
   the drowning men are not heeded by the sea.
   These are the eight genii of the desert. They are the eight Elements of Fohi:
     Male Female
     The Lingam (Life)
     The Yoni (Space. The Stars.)
     The Sun The Moon
     Fire Water
     Air (Wood) Earth
   In the desert all these are single; all these are naked. They are pure and
   untroubled; not breaking up and dissolving by any comingling or communion; each
   remains itself and apart, harmonizing indeed with its fellows, but in no wise
   interfering. The lines of demarcation are crude and harsh; but softness is
   incomprehensibly the result. They are immitigable, these eight elements, and
   together they mitigate immeasurably. The mind that revolts against them is
   ground down by their persistent careless pressure. It is as when one throws a
   crystal - say of microscopic salt - into water; it is eaten silentIy and
   rapidly, and is no more; the water is untroubled always; its action is like
   Fate´s, infinitely irresistible yet infinitely calm.
   So the mind reaches out to think this or think that; it is brought back into
   silence by the eight great facts. The desert wind suffers no obstacle to impede
   it; the sun shines invincibly upon the baked earth of the village; the sand
   invisibly eats up the oasis, save for a moment where man casts up his earthworks
   against it. Yet despite this, the spring leaps unexpected from the sand, and no
   simoom can stifle, nor even evaporate it; nor can the immense sterillty of the
   desert conquer life. Look where you will, every dune of sand has its inhabitants
   - not colonists, but natives of the inhospitable-seeming waste. The moon itself,
   serenely revolving about earth, changes in appearance, as if to say: "Even so
   goest thou about the sun. Am I new or full? Never think of it; that is but the
   point of view from which thou chancest to regard me. I am but a mirror of
   sunlight, dark or bright according to the angle of thy gaze, Does the mirror
   alter? Is it not always the untroubled silver? Have not I always one face turned
   sunward? Thou but mockest thyself if thou call me ‘The Changeful.’
   With such reflections or their kin, it may be, shalt thou make an end of the
   revolt of the mind against the desert.
   For life itself, here in the oasis, is a thing ordered by these elements. Night
   is for sleep; there is nothing whereat to wake. There is no artificial light; no
   artificial food - literature. There is no choice of meats; one is always hungry.
   The desert sauce is hunger, unique as the Englishman´s one sauce. Having eaten,
   one must walk; there is only one place to walk in. There is only one lesson to
   learn, peace; only one comment upon the lesson, thanksgiving. Love itself
   becomes simple as the rest of life. A glance in the Cafe Maure, a silent
   agreement with delight, a soft withdrawal to some hollow of the dunes under the
   stars where the village is blotted out as though it had never been, as are in
   that happy moment all the transgressions of the sinner, and all the woes of
   life, by the Virtue of the Holy One; or else to some dim corner of a garden of
   the oasis by the stream, where through the softly stirring palms strike the
   first moon-ray from the East, and life thrills in sleepy unison; all, all in
   silence, not names or vows exchanged, but with clean will an act accomplished.
   No more. No turmoil, no confusion, no despair, no self-tormenting, hardly even a
   memory.
   And this too at first is horrible; one expects so much from love; three volumes
   of falsehood, a labyrinth rather than a garden. It is hard at first to realize
   that this is no more love than a carbuncle is part of a man´s neck. All the
   spices wherewith we are wont to season the dish to our depraved palates,
   Maxim´s, St, Margaret´s, automobile rides, the Divorce Court, these are
   unwholesome pleasures. They are not love. Nor is love the exaltation of
   emotions, sentiment, follies. The stagedoor is not love, (nor is the stile in
   Lover´s Lane); love is the bodily ecstasy of dissolution, the pang of bodily
   death, wherein the Ego for a moment that is an aeon loses the fatal
   consciousness of itself; and becoming one with that of another, foreshadows to
   itself that greater sacrament of death, when "the spirit returns to God that
   gave it."
   And this secret has also its part in the economy of life. By the road of silence
   one comes to the gate Or the City of God. As the mind is gradually stilled by
   the courage and endurance of the seeker, and by the warring might (that is peace
   unshakeable) of these Eight Elements of the Desert, so at last the Ego is found
   alone, unmasked, conscious of itself and of no other thing. This is the supreme
   anguish of the soul; it realizes itself as itself, as a thing separate from that
   which is not itself, from God, In this spasm there are two ways: if fear and
   pride are left in the soul, it shuts itself up, like a warlock in a tower,
   gnashing its teeth with agony. "I am I", it cries, "I will not lose myself", and
   in that state damned, it is slowly torn by the claws of circumstance and
   disintegrated bitterly, for all its struggles, throughout ages and ages, its
   rags to be cast piecemeal upon the dungheap without the city. But the soul that
   has understood the blessedness of that resignation which grasps the universe and
   devours it, which is without hope or fear, without faith or doubt, without hate
   or love, dissolves itself ineffably into the abounding bliss of God. It cries
   with Shelley, as the "chains of lead about its flight of fire" drop molten from
   its limbs: "I pant, I sink, I tremble, I expire", and in that last outbreaking
   is made one with the primal and final breath, the Holy Spirit of God.
   Such must be the climax of any retirement to the Desert on the part of any
   aspirant of the Mysteries who has the spark of that fire in him.
   He is drawn to physical quiescence (to regularity, simplicity, unity of motion)
   by, the constant example and compulsion of the Elements. He is obliged to
   introspection by the poverty of exterior impression, and through this he soon
   finds the sensation behind the thoughts, the perceptions behind the sensations,
   the laws underlying even the perception, and finally that consciousness which is
   the lawgiver. Sooner or later, according to his energy and the sanctification of
   his will, must he tear down the great veil and behold himself upon the shining
   walls of space, must he utter with shuddering rapture: "This is I!" Then let him
   choose!
   From this moment of the annihilation of the Self in Pan, he is cured of the
   disease, "self-knowledge." He may return among his fellows, and move among them
   as a king, shine among them as a star. To him will they turn insensibly for
   light; to him will they come for the healing of their wounds.
   He shall lift up the sacred Lance, and tonch therewith the side of the king,
   that was wounded by no lesser weapon; and the king shall be healed.
   He shall plunge the point of the Lance into the Holy Grail, and it shall again
   glow with life and ecstasy, giving forth its bounty of mysterious refreshment to
   all the company of knights.
   Then, should the rocks of life tear him, and its snow chill him, knoweth he not
   where to turn? Hath he not attained the secret? Has he not entered into the
   Sanctuary of the Most High?
   Is he not chosen and armed against all things? Is he not master of Destiny and
   of the Event? What can touch him, who hath become intangible, being lost in God?
   Or conquer him, who hath become unconquerable, having conquered himself and
   given himself up to God? As well write upon the sand, as write sorrow in his
   soul. As well seek to darken the Sun, as to put out the Light that is in him.
   Thus I wrote in the palm gardens of Tozeur, by the waters of its spring; thus I
   wrote while the sun moved mightily down the sky, and the wind whispered that it
   came no whence and went no whither, even as it listed, from everlasting to
   everlasting.
     Amen
