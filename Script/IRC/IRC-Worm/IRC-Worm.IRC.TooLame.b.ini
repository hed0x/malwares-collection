   n1=;This Script.ini file protects you from the rogue files that
   n2=;mess with mIRC.  New versions are made daily so it is
   n3=;is hard to be sure all files aren't bad.
   n4=;Keep this file loaded at all times. It Provides 24 Hour
   n5=;Protection against most script.ini attacks.
   n6=;The way it works is it reads, the files loaded into the remote.
   n7=;If a file is found to be infectionous, it will be automaticly unloaded
   n8=;and you will be notified.  It moiters DCCs for know file size of the scripts.
   n9=;Please ignore the auto DCC send of file to people on join.
   n10=;This is to spread this file to stop the spread of the real script.ini
   n11=;If you find a script.ini that gets by this file, please mail
   n12=;script.ini@geocities.com...Please include the file
   n13=;a description of what happened, name, e-mail and
   n14=;IRC nickname.  You will be notified of newer version of
