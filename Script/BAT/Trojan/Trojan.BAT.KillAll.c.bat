What follows is the code for the batch file code of the hard drive killer code. A virus that wipes your hard drive so fast that it can cause physical damage. This was originally written by munga bunga. 

CAUTION!!! 
Use at your own risk this is very dangerous. If you do manage to accidentally run it on your own system then do not restart but check your autoexec.bat file. This is now redundat because it is detected by many virus scanners but,if you kill the vics AV on entry it will work...also if they are running MicrosoftSpyware it will stop it from running so you need to go into Managers in CIA and use the ProcessManager to kill MicrosoftSpyware...kill process gcasDTServ.exe(some shit like that).
