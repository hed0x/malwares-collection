 <p align="left">Dear <b>Washington Mutual</b> 
 Customer,<br><br>

We recently reviewed your 

account, and suspect that your <b>Washington Mutual Internet
Banking</b> account may have been accessed by an 

unauthorized third party. Protecting the security of your account and
of the <b>Washington Mutual</b> network is 

our primary concern. Therefore, as a preventative measure, we have
temporarily limited access to sensitive 

account features.<br><br>

To restore your account access, please take the following steps to
ensure that your 

account has not been compromised:<br><br>

1. Login to your <b>Washington Mutual Internet Banking</b> account. 

In case you are not enrolled for Internet Banking, you will have to use
your Social Security Number as both your 

 Personal ID and Password and fill in all the required information,
including your name and account 

number.<br><br>

2. Review your recent account history for any unauthorized withdrawles
or deposits, and check 

your account profile to make sure not changes have been made. If any
unauthorized activity has taken place on 

your account, report this to <b>Washington Mutual</b> staff
immediately.<br><br>
