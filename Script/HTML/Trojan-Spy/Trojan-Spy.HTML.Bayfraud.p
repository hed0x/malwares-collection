<p>Dear eBay Member,</p>
<p>During our regularly scheduled account maintenance and verification 
procedures, we have detected a slight error in your billing information.</p>
<p>This might be due to either of the following reasons:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> A recent change in your personal information ( i.e.change 
of address).<br>
<strong>2.</strong> Submiting invalid information during the initial sign up 
process.<br>
<strong>3.</strong> An inability to accurately verify your selected option of 
payment due to an internal error within our processors.</p>
<p>Go to your account page and verify your informations: </p>
