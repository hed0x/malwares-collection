Dear valued SunTrust member, 
<br><br>
Due to concerns, for the safety and integrity of the online banking community we have issued the following warning message.
<br><br>
It has come to our attention that your account information needs to be confirmed due to inactive customers, fraud and spoof reports. If you could please take 5-10 minutes out of your online experience and renew your records you will not run into any future problems with the online service. However, failure to confirm your records may result in your account suspension.
<br><br>
You can confirm your account records by logging in to your internet banking account. Once you have confirmed your account records your internet banking service will not be interrupted and will continue as normal.&nbsp;</font>
