   Usage Instructions (data gathering)
   ------------------

   1. Goto the board you wish to change the permissions for in the normal way
      using a browser.
   2. Find the base directory location of the board for the script,
      i.e. if the main page was http://www.server.com/phpBB2/index.php
      the base directory location would be http://www.server.com/phpBB2
      - without the trailing slash
   3. Goto the boards "Memberlist" page (usually located at the top with the
      rest of the links)
   4. Search the "Memberlist" page for the specific account you wish to change
      the permissions for, and click the username, then note down the number
      at the end of the page URL you are at. (u=?)
   5. Fill in the details obtained where asked for in the following prompts.

   in it etc.
