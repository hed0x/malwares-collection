   I hold no responsibility for the use of this "IE sux" Internet explorer trojan, even though I developed it.  I do not endorse its use.  Its use was to specifically prove the possibility of getting hacked through a web page. It can be stopped by increasing security in IE 4-5.5 to High. I haven't tested this code extensively, but intend to retest it on VMware to prove that it works... It seems to act differently on different computers. Also, It can be detected by many virus detectors.  I did not discover this exploit.. George Guninski did so he actually deserves alot of credit.

   <p>HAHAHA&nbsp; For you losers using IE 5.* this is an excellent reason not to use IE.
   &nbsp; ! I'll give you this chance to checkout your dodged up registry and your bootup
   files...&nbsp; I hear that the Windows Setup CD comes useful in a situation like this...
   You dont even know what I messed with.&nbsp; I worship those who use linux as you will
   find, that all you will get are a couple of errors with my evil java code.&nbsp; I suggest
   opening this page from the school... Definately alot of fun.&nbsp; Anyone using Netscape
   should be safe. &nbsp; Also, since this page is used for education value.&nbsp; You cant
   blame me. &nbsp; I'm simply educating you about the dangers of using IE.&nbsp;You wanted
   to know why it sux so bad and this was the best way of explaining it.&nbsp; If you have
   been affected by the code, tell me.&nbsp; I haven't tested it yet ;)&nbsp; And that is why
   Internet Explorer Sux.</p>

   <p>Ps: Alt+cnrl+del will not save your ass.&nbsp; The prompts come up after files have
   been modified.&nbsp;&nbsp; And btw, a clean reinstall is not required but I HIGHLY
   RECOMMEND.&nbsp; No trojans have been installed in your registry so dont worry..... Thats
   what's left of your registry.&nbsp; The only files that have been messed up will be fixed
   after reinstalling windows, in theory.&nbsp; I actually recommend continuing with the
   prompts so that you know what has been changed.</p>
