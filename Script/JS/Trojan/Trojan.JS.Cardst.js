<h1>At 29 Sep 6pm!</h1></a></div><br>


 <p align="left">Saturday, September 30   9:06 AM<br><br><br>

           <div style="clear:both;"></div>At 6pm then the girl hands over her outstanding stuffs to me!  Haiz..  stayed till 7pm to hear her say and say, explain and explain...  Oh my!  Made my this weekend seems miserable cos' will be thinking there's lots of stuffs to clear for her on Monday  =(  And this includes filing where she's supposed to do it last year till now!  Oh my!...  why leave filing to me??  Then I'm not very sure of which files to file into lo...  nevermind, I told myself ->  I'm clever Linda, so there shouldn't be anything too hard for me.. wahaha!  Guess I just have to figure out myself.  Worse come to worse, ask boss lo.. hehe!<br /><br />And hor.. the funny thing is...  boss doesn't want me to sit on this girl's seat cos' the back is facing the main door.  Thus, unable to see incoming people.  So, boss (he) wants me to sit at my presnt seat which is spared from the day I went in.  But the thing is, I need to use the in-house software and the same email account that the girl had been using lo.. and maybe I'll need to refer to past soft copy files that are stored in the girl's com!  When I asked if software can be installed into my com, boss just replied, "We are very open, actually.  You are free to choose where you wana sit.  BUT, I personally would like you to sit at your present seat in order to see incoming people and attend to them quickly."<br />So.....  conclusion:<br />1) He's not able to install the software into my com.<br />2) I'm supposed to sit at my present seat while figuring out how to gain access to the email and the software without having to shift my butt.<br /><br />Ths only thing I can think of is to exchange the CPUs lo..  BUT, I'm unwilling to do so lei..  cos' the girl's com very slow!  It has a lot of stuffs lo.. thus, made the system very very de SLOW!  She kept emails dated back to 2004.  Some emails I personally think that there's no need to keep one lo.. since it had to be printed out as hard copy.  And I always like to do house keeping on my emails one lei..  hmm...  shall see how lah, if really wana do house keeping on her email account ah, I think I'll take days to finish it...  1st things 1st (ie, finish current impt stuffs first.)  Was thinking, maybe I can just transfer the software over.. but, the email account thing lei???  Haiz...  need to double check on this with our out-sourced IT guy  =(<br /><br />Arrggghhhh... the thought of Monday made me sick!  And I have to shift her stationeries and files over to my seat..  I got a smaller space lo...  cos' there's two finance cabinets on my table!  See how lah.....   haiz<br /><br />Going Paya Lebar later, to shop shop, see can buy more clothings or not... hee!<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

Actually, the ends of my hair started to curl a bit few days later.  Wanted to go back and ask for rectification, but everytime, after I wash my hair, it became straight again.  It only curls everytime I woke up from bed.  So, was thinking if this is natural.  And at the same time, thinking that if I go back for rectification, worser results might arise - such as, straighter but not natural hair; more damaged hair; stylist refuses to rectify when I reach there, telling me it's like that, etc etc..  then waste my trip there.  I have to go back to JE branch one, so it's a bit troublesome lo.  Quite a few no. of people told me to go back and let them do again.  But, lazy lei... heehee!  See how again lah, I have up to Tuesday to have the free rectification done  =)<br /><br />================================================================<br /><br /><strong>Eat live leeches in Fear Factor!</strong><br /><a href='http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/187/6361/320/13092006030.jpg'><img border='0' style='border:2px solid #FFFFFF; margin:2px' src='http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/187/6361/320/13092006030.jpg'></a><br /><br />This is a pic that I took while watching Fear Factor.  Very disgusting lo.. in fact, a lady finishes the whole plate lei..  SUPERB!  I wonder the leeches will be still alive inside her stomach and suck her blood dry??  Eeeks!<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

 <p align="left">Friday, September 8   9:10 PM<br><br><br>

           <div style="clear:both;"></div>It's raining now and I'm at home now.  Nothing to do.  Tar working, Zhen out with Simon on a birthday shopping spree.  Seldom update my blog nowadays cos seldom on my computer when I got back home from work.  Don't wana face computer again.  But, tonight really too boring le.<br /><br />Work is so~far~so~good  =D<br />Was quite busy yesterday and today cos' the gal (I'm replacing) was on leave yesterday and in only noon today  =X  So, read her emails and see what I can do to help.  When she's back today noon, then suddenly not much thing to do.  Cos hor.. boss doesn't want to announce my "existence" yet.  So, can't use my email add or name to send documents/faxes/emails yet.  So, a bit troublesome lo.  So, I can say that it's not a 100% hand-over yet.  So, dont know whether can handle or not when she's finally gone  =X  And, heard from her that, Oct onwards is considered peak period le..  before CNY also peak period  =X  hmm.....  hopefully I can handle without staying late late everytime and without having to ask boss too much questions  =X  So, will have to clear all my doubts before she leaves..<br /><br /><br />Enough of work le lah!  Weekend's approaching!  Tomorrow going out with Zhen, BB and Shir to celebrate Zhen's birthday!   =)   Relax and Enjoy Time!<br /><br /><br />By the way, Serene's baby gal finally out on Wednesday morning!!<br />Serene's Birthday Gal on 06/09/2006  =)<br /><a href='http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/187/6361/320/06092006010.jpg'><img border='0' style='border:2px solid #FFFFFF; margin:2px' src='http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/187/6361/320/06092006010.jpg'></a><br /><br />Such a beautiful baby  =)  I think she looks like her dad more.  Gotta wait till she grows older then will know cos' babies' features kept changing as they grow.  So, <strong>Serene</strong> ===> gotta take pictures every now and then to capture her changes and growing up!!  Think you'll be too busy recuperating + taking care of baby + husband to come to my blog to read now..  haha...  but don't forget all about us when you get bored during these 3 months ah..  see if can meet up when free k  =)  Take care!<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>
