				</font><font face="Arial">CALGARY'S MELISSA O'NEIL CROWNED 
				CANADIAN IDOL</font></b><font face="Arial"><b><br>
		        </b><font color="#00FFFF">Tonight's show started out with a 
				choir singing a capella You Can't Always Get What You Want and 
				doing a very good job, but then the Top-10 enters... the band 
				starts playing and Josh takes over. Next Daryl takes over with 
				Ruby Tuesday, Emily and Ashley sing To Sir with Love and Amber 
				and Casey perform Imagine. Melissa and Rex take over from them 
				with Somebody to Love and Aaron and Suzi sing Can't get no 
				Satisfaction. Then the whole group comes back to You Can't 
				Always Get What You Want. What a way to start this episode! 
				Break time!</font></font><p align="left">
				<font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">After the commercial break, 
				we're re-introduced to the &quot;King of the Rock&quot; Rex Goudie. We 
				switch over live to Corner Brook, Nfld. and see tons and tons of 
				enthusiastic people, and my personal favourite ATV personality 
				MairiAnna Bachynsky. MairaAnna informs us that tickets were sold 
				out in about an hour and we see Rex' best friend Erin who has 
				some nice words for him.</font><p align="left">
				<font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">Next up is a video segment 
				with the Top-2 being coached by the Barenaked Ladies. Jon Dore, 
				who is in the audience, gets the honour of announcing the next 
				song (with some mustard on it, per Ben's request)... the 
				Barenaked Ladies. BNL perform their hit single &quot;One Week&quot;. After 
				the song Ben and BNL members chat a bit. BNL reveals their next 
				project is a tribute to the unknown singer Ben Mulroney. Their 
				advice for Rex and Melissa? It's not too late to back out now...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				time for another commercial break.</font><p align="left">
				<font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">After the break we get the 
				same treatment Rex had but for the other competitor left 
				standing, &quot;Free Spirit of the West&quot; Melissa O'Neil. We switch 
				live to Calgary but despite the camera tricks there aren't as 
				many people there as in Corner Brook. Melissa's mother, Alison 
				Yueng has some nice words for her. Her father is as always very 
				much present in the audience.</font><p align="left">
				<font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">Next up is some footage of 
				the &quot;High Notes&quot; Canadian Idol 3 compilation CD release party in 
				Fairview Mall. This is an introduction to the eliminated members 
				of the Top-10 who will sing part of their song that is on the 
				CD. Emily starts out, then Ashley, then Amber. The singing goes 
				pretty well except for Daryl who seems to have trouble with his 
				voice. Josh and Casey are next. The ones who were done remained 
				on the stage and suddenly everyone starts running and jumping 
				around, which can mean only one thing: Suzi Rawn hits the stage! 
				Finally Aaron, eliminated last week, sings his song.</font><p align="left">
				<font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">Next up is Sass who talks 
				about the auditioning process and the competition, what it feels 
				like from the performers' point of view.</font><p align="left">
				<font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">On behalf of all the Judges, 
				Sass takes to the stage in a tribute to the auditioners. Sass 
				sings Stevie Wonder's &quot;All In Love is Fair&quot;. Sass is doing a 
				good job emoting the song and is really putting her heart into 
				the performance. Too bad her collegues (who in a quick audience 
				shot appeared to be missing!?) didn't have time to give her some 
				of their thoughts (they wouldn't <i>dare</i> to say anything bad 
				anyway).</font><p align="left">
				<font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">Next up is a segment on 
				American Idol (4 seasons) and Canadian Idol (2 seasons) vocal 
				coach Debra Byrd, affectionately known as just Byrd. For the 
				first time ever on any of these Idol shows, Byrd takes to the 
				stage to show her abilities. Byrd performs Dionne Warwick's <i>
				I'll Never Love This Way Again</i> as a tribute to her students. 
				Byrd has a great voice and is pulling off a stunning 
				performance. At the end Byrd lets loose and redefines vocal 
				control. When she's done we see Farley getting down on one knee, 
				taking off his hat, and then giving a big hug. The Top-10 also 
				floods on the stage and Byrd is having an emotional moment. 
				Little did she know what was in store for her. Aaron said that 
				on behalf of the whole Top-10, they'd like to thank her in the 
				only way they know how. The Top-10 sing to her, the very 
				appropriate <i>Dedicated To The One That I Love</i> (first 
				recorded in 1958 by The 5 Royales, better known is The Shirelles' 
				re-release in 1963, also covered by The Mamas and The Papas in 
				1967). Debra Byrd is absolutely amazed and is loving it. It's 
				sad that on the 4 years of American Idol no one ever thought of 
				doing this.</font><p align="left">
				<font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">After the break, Kalan Porter 
				took to the stage with his band. Wow, what can someone change in 
				a year. I hardly recognize him. He seems taller, his hair 
				longer, his voice changed, and he dresses a bit 'girly'. Kalan 
				performs <i>In Spite of It All</i> from his album 219 Days. 
				After the performance Kalan reveals his sophomore album is out 
				in spring, and Ben presents him with the double platinum award 
				for his debut CD. His advice for Rex and Melissa? &quot;Run...&quot;.</font><p align="left">
				<font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">After that, Kalan agrees to 
				sing another song: The Devil Went Down To Georgia and Kalan 
				plays the violin. Wow, what a great song and he's doing an 
				excellent job on both the fiddling and the singing. Then Rex 
				joins in and so does Melissa. It turns into a duet between the 
				two of them, with Kalan doing the violin parts. Rex changes the 
				word a bit to fit the occasion and the audience is very 
				impressed with this performance.</font><p align="left">
				<font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">After the break we see a 
				segment with some of the Top-10's parents. We see Rex' mom, 
				Aaron's dad, Amber's mom, Daryl's dad, Aaron's mom, Melissa's 
				mom, Rex' dad, Josh's dad, Josh's mom, Melissa's dad, Suzi's 
				dad, Emily's mom, Ashley's mom and Casey's mom. Melissa 
				announces that the next song will be dedicated to the friends 
				and family who support them behind the stage. The Idols sing 
				what appears to be <i>Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life)</i> by 
				Green Day, but there's something from with the microphones. 
				Ashley's mic didn't work and neither did Emily's. Josh's mic 
				worked after a while and near the end they all appeared to be 
				working.</font><p align="left">
				<font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">During the commercial break 
				we learn that INVASION will finally start next Wednesday, since 
				Canadian Idol is over you should have enough time to watch this 
				new show.</font><p align="left">
				<font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">A quick view at what's going 
				on in Calgary, the judges' &quot;tribute tape&quot; and Melissa's own 
				&quot;tribute tape&quot; (that's normally used when a competitor has been 
				eliminated) and we get to Melissa singing her own favourite song 
				of the competition. It turns out to be the Big Band song, Cole 
				Porter's <i>It's Delovely</i> (sung by Ella Fitzgerald). As 
				usual, it's another great performance by Melissa and she picked 
				a great song from her repertoire.</font><p align="left">
				<font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">After the break, Rex gets the 
				same treatment. His pick is also the Big Band song, <i>Feeling 
				Good</i> in the Michael Bublé version. Again and as always, Rex 
				is doing a great job.</font><p align="left">
				<font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">After the break, we have yet 
				another look back (c'mon, this is one too many) at the journeys 
				of Rex and Melissa in Canadian Idol. Next Melissa and Rex 
				perform an excellent duet, Phil Collins' <i>Against All Odds</i>. 
				Wow. This is absolutely a terrific performance and the best of 
				the night. The 'acting' and singing is flawless, save for one 
				small mistake by Rex when he didn't hold the mic up fast enough. 
				That aside, I think they should put this track on the next 
				Canadian Idol single as a Bonus Track. At the end, Rex kissed 
				Melissa's hand, they kissed each other on the cheek and gave a 
				big hug. Casey was crying in the audience.</font><p align="left">
				<font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">After the commercial break, 
				the judges give some parting words; Jake thanks the 1,100 people 
				who work on the show and Ben in particular. </font>
		<p align="left">
				<font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">Ben announces over 3.6 
				million votes were cast (3.65 million actually) and that it was 
				the closest vote in Canadian Idol history.</font><p align="left">
				<font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">Before the result is made 
				public, Rex wants to show his &quot;true colours&quot; and slips in a 
				Toronto Maple Leafs jersey, number 29 &quot;GOUDIE&quot;.</font><p align="left">
				<font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">Then Ben gets down to what 
				we've all been waiting for: Canada voted... and the name of the 
				next Canadian Idol... is Melissa O'Neil!!!</font><p align="left">
				<font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">Melissa is going wild when 
				Ben asks her about her feelings. She must be so happy, relieved, 
				excited, sad for Rex, proud of her achievements, all at the same 
				time. To celebrate, Melissa sings us out with the Canadian Idol 
				single Alive, which will be digitally distributed to radio 
				stations starting at 1:00 am ET tomorrow (Thursday), so you 
				should be able to hear it when you wake up.</font><p align="left">
				<font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">When the last song of this 
				season is sung, we see an emotional end to this season's 
				Canadian Idol show with the Top-10, the Judges, Ben, Jon and 
				Melissa's dad.<br>
